# Exploratory-Data-Analysis--Sample-Supestore
This project involved conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sample store dataset provided by The Sparks Foundation at GRIP, where I was a TSF-Intern. The goal was to identify weak areas in the retail business where improvements could be made to increase profitability.
